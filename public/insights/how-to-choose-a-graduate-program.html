<h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-7aaac16c gb-headline-text">Never pay for a Master’s or PhD in Spanish</h3>


<div class="gb-container gb-container-3b45116b">

<p>Universities that offer graduate degrees in Spanish often have well-developed undergraduate programs in Spanish, and they save a lot of money by using their graduate students as Teaching Assistants (TAs) to teach their undergraduate Spanish courses. Unlike other academic areas, Spanish TAs teach their classes as the “professor” of the class; they don’t assist somebody else who’s teaching the class. If you accept a teaching assistantship—and you’re the “professor” of the class—you should receive full tuition remission (meaning you don’t pay tuition for your graduate education), and you should receive a salary for your work, as well as comprehensive health insurance. TA remuneration can vary enormously from university to university, and, no surprise, how much you get paid can significantly affect your quality of life and, perhaps, your sense of well-being while you’re fulfilling the requirements of your program. For example, some universities offer just over $18,000/year (2025). In some cases, you’re also contractually obligated to <strong>not</strong> have outside employment. It’s easy to imagine how this combination of low pay and no outside employment could lead to financial struggles that—in one way or another— show up in your academic performance. According to the <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federal-poverty-level-fpl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">U.S. Federal Poverty Guidelines for 2024</a>, a single-income, single-person household with an income of <strong>$15,060</strong> or less is living in poverty. If you accept that TAship from one of these universities, you will earn a TA salary near the poverty level. If you don’t have an outside income source, or help from somewhere (family, scholarships, grants, stipends, etc.), you could effectively live unpleasantly close to the poverty level. When you start comparing Spanish graduate programs, it’s prudent, then, to dive into the economics of life as a Spanish graduate student. You may find sharp and meaningful differences between your top choices. New York University, for example, offers a TA salary plus a $35,000 stipend (free money), but that generosity needs to be evaluated in the context of living in New York City, one the most expensive cities in the United States. Other universities might cover your tuition and expenses without your having to teach at all. Duke University, for example, does this for their entering PhD students in literature. Not teaching at the beginning of your program can be a smart idea from a time-use and energy perspective, even if you love teaching. When you teach for your department, you typically spend a significant part of your time preparing for classes, shuttling back and forth to class, teaching class, providing your students office hours, meetings with your supervisors and others, being “stuck” on campus for hours between the class you teach and the class you take, and long bouts of grading. While teaching right away can be novel and rewarding, it will take time and emotional resources away from other meaningful graduate student efforts, especially if you care about your students and you’re a meticulous and supportive teacher, which, chances are, you will be.</p>

<h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-e9f77065 gb-headline-text">Examine faculty profiles carefully</h3>


<div class="gb-container gb-container-5bbeb61d">

<p>Examine faculty profiles to match your academic interests with the interests and publishing of the professors within the department. If you definitely want to study Golden Age literature and nobody in the department lists it in their profile as an interest, nor publishes research in that area, look elsewhere. If you want to study Hispanic sociolinguistics and no professor lists anything along those lines (like variationism, ethnography, contact linguistics), go elsewhere. Remember, this is years of your life, and during each one of those years, a certain set of classes will be offered, quite often based solely on the interests of the faculty. Eventually, you’ll find yourself being required to take a course or two that truly don’t interest you because you have to fulfill credit requirements for academic terms. Faculty interests will even show up in “general” courses, let’s say, history of Spanish. A sociolinguist is likely to lecture on linguistic changes reflected through social class, gender, ethnicity, and regional variation across different time periods, while a specialist in literary analysis might focus more on the evolution of written texts and their cultural significance throughout history. Both approaches are valid and can be enlightening, but they demonstrate how faculty expertise shapes even foundational courses. Check faculty profiles and publication history. Are you interested?</p>



<p>If you’re in linguistics, you’re probably going to use numbers to arrive at your studies’ conclusions, and having scholars who take a special interest in quantitative methods can help you get a handle on statistical methods that will certainly recur in your career, whether you’re reading research or producing it. If you want to be trained in quantitative methods in linguistics (how to correctly use and interpret probability and statistics in your research), and the department lacks that kind of expertise, consider a different program, or open your search to include other departments and opportunities at the university. For example, most universities have a separate linguistics department (relative to the <em>Spanish</em> linguistics department), and there may be close collaboration between the regular linguistics department and the Spanish department. Find out because the regular linguistics department may complement the Spanish department very nicely for your areas of interest, and they may have methodologists who will help you become a confident, productive social scientist. So, check faculty profiles in the linguistics department as well. </p>



<p>It might also be a good idea to examine the courses that have been taught in the last year or two, if you can get the information. If you were interested in studying Spanish linguistics at the University of California, Davis (UCD), for example, and there were no quantitative specialists nor courses dedicated to quantitative linguistic research in the last two years, a review of the UCD linguistics department will reveal that indeed they have scholars who teach statistics for linguistic research, and regularly offer relevant courses. Chances are, you can take those classes and get credit for them. And if you’re really dedicated to becoming a powerful “quant” researcher, you might find excellent courses offered by the statistics department, the sociology department, and others, and there may also be data science initiatives at the university. Perhaps join an initiative after you’ve got a handle on your primary studies.</p>

<h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-7c2f8a55 gb-headline-text">Examine current student profiles</h3>


<div class="gb-container gb-container-4d9e2ebe">

<p>Match student profiles with faculty profiles to get a sense of what the academic foci are in the department. Whether you’re writing a thesis (Master’s) or a dissertation (PhD), you’ll want to ensure that the department not only has scholars with the type of expertise you need, but there is evidence that students are pursuing research you find interesting, ostensibly under the direction of faculty members. </p>

<h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-ef88cc09 gb-headline-text">Understand the importance of networking</h3>


<div class="gb-container gb-container-8bd9d171">

<p>Who you know matters in academia. A well-connected professor can give you a reference that open doors. Fellow graduates from the same university who found academic employment may also be able to influence a hiring decision in your favor. Co-authoring academic work can be an excellent strategy for exponentially increasing your academic productivity and recognition. This, in turn, can influence hiring decisions, salary decisions, and the speed of ascending from assistant professor to associate to full professor. While researching a department, pay attention to where the professors earned their degrees, specifically their PhD. Where did the department’s recent graduates go? You may notice regional hiring trends among universities, or special links across the country. If a Spanish program is on your shortlist, you would be wise to get a feel for the personal-professional network you would plug yourself into because where you go next could depend it.</p>

<h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-08016b9f gb-headline-text">Don’t rely on university rankings</h3>


<div class="gb-container gb-container-9fa59257">

<p>University rankings today have the same problems they had in earlier decades. In 2010, the <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/an-assessment-of-research-doctorate-programs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Research Council</a> published the most comprehensive graduate school rankings to date, and they included a set of program rankings for U.S. Spanish departments. Fortunately, some really good critical thinkers have looked into these rankings. These thinkers, some of the best scholars we have, concluded that the NRC ranking was highly problematic. The NRC was just another organization attempting to rank the un-rankable. They were charged with making errors that, when corrected, completely changed the rankings (evinced by the “more-correct” 2011 version available online). The ranking considered the productivity of a department’s professors as the best indicator of the department’s quality. Productivity was measured by the number of peer-reviewed articles, conference proceedings, book chapters, and books published by professors, and by how often their works were cited (their impact). Keep in mind that some academic journals are highly selective, and others are not. Since the NRC did not consider academic journal selectivity, the faculty productivity variable – the most important one in their study – was improperly operationalized (defined for use in the study) and didn’t accurately measure quality, and the rankings derived from this measure can’t be correct. Also consider that Spanish departments are typically small, meaning that the departure of just one (1) highly productive scholar would radically change the NRC rank of that department relative to others. As a future graduate student, faculty productivity measured by publications could be meaningless to you if the faculty, regardless of their productivity, aren’t good mentors. </p>



<p>Forget these mass rankings, including all the new ones. They’re not created for sophisticated thinkers, and the way they model “quality” may have nothing to do with you and what will be quality for you. Create a ranking based on what’s important to you, and keep the above points in mind when you do it.

<h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-09454989 gb-headline-text">Don’t rely on search results from the Internet</h3>


<div class="gb-container gb-container-d41ec80f">

<p>The algorithms that Google, Bing and others use to deliver search results is completely unrelated to the quality of Spanish graduate programs and how well they will fit your interests and aspirations. These algorithms do an excellent job of helping you find many things, but finding a quality university programs that matches your interests is not one of them. For example, search results are often tweaked depending on where your IP address (you) are physically located. If you use a VPN like Nord VPN to protect your privacy and diminish the chances of getting hacked (a very good idea), search results may change to reflect the random IP address you’re on. The programs the show up at the top of the rankings may not be the best fit for you. Also, Some universities have search engine optimization experts who can manipulate the signals picked up by, say, Google, and their university’s programs wind up at the top of the search results. Better, set time aside and go through the unaltered list of universities for <a href="https://spanishacademic.com/spanish-literature" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish Literature here</a>, and for <a href="https://spanishacademic.com/spanish-linguistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish Linguistics here</a>.</p>

<h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-a39fe25a gb-headline-text">Use AI for what it is</h3>


<div class="gb-container gb-container-62edff3a">

<p>Large language model artificial intelligence like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini do not have consciousness, and will not guide you to the right academic program without a fair amount of effort on your part. The “consciousness” references are eye-rolling marketing hype, and clear click bait on YouTube. That’s not to downplay LLM usefulness, but it is to make you aware that your ability to understand where you will fit in an academic program is squarely in the realm of your own consciousness – with good information, patience, talking to faculty and staff, friends and family, and sleeping on it more than once. Certainly, use AI for what it is. If you fed this article into one of LLM services, along with data from Spanish programs you’re considering and your preferences, you may be able to interrogate the LLM to help you uncover things quickly. For example, “Create a table that includes the tuition, expenses, cost of living, TA benefits, and the size of the surrounding Spanish-speaking population, and I want a good all-you-can-eat sushi buffet nearby.” LLMs can be good assistants in this respect, but rely on yourself to make the decision, especially given the fact that LLMs often forge realistic-looking information and lie repeatedly (i.e., “hallucinate”) instead of saying “I don’t know” when it can’t find information.</p>

<h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-c5595de1 gb-headline-text">Complete your PhD degree in the United States…perhaps</h3>


<div class="gb-container gb-container-257ee907">

<p>At present (2025– 2026), if you want a U.S. university teaching position at a research university after you graduate, you may be passed over for the job if you completed your PhD abroad. Why? Albeit based more on observation and scuttlebutt than science, the reason may be because a PhD is essentially research degree, and foreign degree-granting institutions in Spain and Latin America may not train academic researchers with the same empirical rigor as institutions in the United States. This is certainly an unfair assumption in many cases. Also, it’s common to complete your PhD in three (3) years abroad (as in Europe), so hiring universities in the U.S. may question the depth and breadth of the PhD candidate’s training if they studied abroad. This may also be unfair. The Master’s degree in both Hispanic Literature and Hispanic Linguistics at Arizona State University is three (3) years, so that degree is equivalent to a PhD from abroad in terms of normative time to degree. It’s unfortunate because pursing a graduate degree from a Spanish-speaking country could greatly benefit graduate students coming from the U.S., like Spanish heritage speakers or Spanish second language learners. Certainly there are many benefits from living in a Spanish-speaking culture during academic training in Spanish. If you would like to take your chances and do your PhD work abroad, ensure that you study research methods with aplomb, that you network with U.S. graduate students and professors through collaborations and conferences, that you (perhaps) find a U.S. professor to be part of your dissertation committee (if allowed), and that you publish as much as possible in highly regarded academic journals that are edited by U.S.-based scholars.</p>

<div class="gb-container gb-container-87ec7d55">

<p>Many graduate students of Hispanic literatures and linguistics will later seek employment in higher education. If this is your goal, understand immediately that you will be expected to prove that you are dedicated to three central activities: (1) teaching, (2) research and publishing, and (3) service to the institution and/or community. From a purely economic viewpoint, teaching pays the university’s bills, and yours. Service, from the same viewpoint, is good publicity for the university, and for you. Research, coupled with selective publishing, will distinguish you from your colleagues, and it will accelerate and advance your career. It’s safe to say that scholars of Hispanic linguistics and literature who know how to conduct research and get their research published will be less likely to get stuck in lecturer or adjunct Limbo ad infinitum. A lecturer is the lowest on the totem pole among permanent teaching staff, and the adjunct position is typically temporary. Yet many lecturers and adjuncts have doctorate degrees and are as equally qualified (on paper) as the “full professors” who are paid much, much more and typically teach far fewer classes. In rank order, the academic positions in most U.S. universities and college are Lecturer/Adjunct Professor, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Full Professor, and Distinguished Professor. In many cases, what distinguishes one professor from another is their research record, academic publishing successes, and collaboration and networking skills. Here’s the rub: too often lecturers and adjuncts are treated as grunt teaching labor and, to survive economically, they are forced to teach so many courses – and courses they don’t particularly like – that they don’t have time to improve their research skills, conduct research, publish (a time-consuming process that’s sometimes emotionally exhausting), and network. How do you avoid getting trapped in some sort of professional limbo? Realize early on that you must (not may) approach your academic career as being comprised of three larger, interdependent parts: (1) domain expertise, and (2) the ability to competently perform research, and (3) the wherewithal to network effectively (basically, make friends in your field). The first, your domain expertise, is what you’re studying, and probably the reason you’re going to graduate school for Spanish in the first place. The second, the ability to do research, is the set of complementary skills you’ll need to contribute to and advance your field, and be successful on the academic market since being brilliant is not as measurable as your number of publications. The third, networking, should not be underestimated. As soon as possible, even before you begin your program, figure out, for your research area, how research is done, where research is published, and where are potential future academic buddies showing up.</p>



<p>For those interested in linguistics, the research traditions are broadly categorized as quantitative and qualitative. <em>Quantitative</em>, as mentioned earlier, involves using and interpreting statistics (which anybody can do with a can-do attitude and proper training). <em>Qualitative </em>is broadly narrative, providing a story about what you observed and making good guesses about what it all means, based on past research efforts in the field and on your experience and intuition, but embedded in dense academic-ese with lots of buzzwords familiar to that area of research. In reality, there’s no such thing as purely quantitative research because the numbers and figures generated need to be interpreted through a narrative analyses. </p>



<p>When you get into your program, demand training in both quantitative and qualitative research, and pay special attention to the quantitative methods because decades of quantitative research in Spanish linguistics, and in the social sciences very broadly, is based on misunderstanding statistics, particularly the role of <em>p-values</em> and statistical “significance.” Tread lightly, however. Many of your professors are likely to have built their research record, and concomitant ascendancy though professorial ranks, on making claims based on statistical significance. They won’t like it if you suggest they don’t know statistics, pointing out that “A <em>p-value</em>, or statistical significance, does not measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result” (Wasserstein, R. L., &amp; Lazar, N. A., 2016). We don’t make fast friends correcting other people’s grammar (uninvited); and we don’t often make fast friends correcting other peoples’ statistics (uninvited) – especially academics who tend to be uncommonly insecure in this area. If you’re curious about this topic, check out the very-easy-to-understand and very short <em><a href="https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/p-valuestatement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Statement on Statistical Significance and P-values</a></em> issued by the American Statistical Association’s, which is the source of the Wasserstein &amp; Lazar quote above. If you can’t get the statistical training you need in your department, enroll in quantitative methods classes from other departments at your university or college.

<p>Exploring your interests in graduate school is completely legitimate. If this is the case for you, it may be wise to choose a larger program (more professors and students) with a larger number of faculty interests and specialties. It may also advisable to choose a program that offers both literature and Hispanic linguistics. Switching between literature and linguistics happens, even for students who swear allegiance to one or another when they start their graduate studies. If a program has Spanish linguistics, literature, and translation and interpretation programs, wonderful. Be careful to make decisions that keep your options open if you don’t know what you want to study. You don’t want to be part of the “failed to complete degree” or “took more than 8 years to complete” statistics because you didn’t jive with literature or linguistics or translation/interpretation.</p>

<div class="gb-container gb-container-fa77938c">

<p>It’s natural to worry about whether you’ll successfully complete your MA or PhD program in Spanish. Feeling unsure about one’s scholarly abilities is common, especially among new entrants. Some graduate students – and some professors – suffer from “<a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-to-overcome-impostor-syndrome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">imposter syndrome</a>,” which is feeling like you’re not up to par with your colleagues, or worse, feeling like an intellectual phony. When you’re part of higher education, you realize there are a lot of smart people with extraordinary expertise in a number of areas, areas you may never dominate. The more you learn in your own area of research, the more you realize how much more there is to learn. You might also notice that somebody else appears to have detailed, encyclopedic knowledge of a subject, and they can call it forth at any moment. They might get lots of attention and admiration. When you’re around them, you might get the feeling that you’re not at the same level, and you might feel like an imposter given all the smiling, witty, bright people around, leaving you feeling alienated and anxious. Few people can perform their best under these circumstances. </p>



<p>Being unsure about whether you’re good enough to complete your program when you apply to graduate school could be considered a kind of pre-imposter syndrome. It’s best to eliminate those feelings immediately and boldly pursue whatever you’re truly interested in without considering how smart or accomplished or appealing others may seem. Don’t be intimidated by faculty and graduate student profiles. They worked their tails off for long periods of time to pull together the profiles you’re reading. If you apply and get into a program, you’re good enough to get going and find your way. The faculty admitting you believe in you. If you don’t get in, try elsewhere. Remember, you might be academically sound, and even brilliant, and still not get into a department you’re targeting. There’s a lot going on in the background you might not be aware of. For example, a department might be shifting its focus toward Caribbean and Afro-Latin American literary studies, with plans to hire new faculty specializing in these areas, but haven’t yet updated their website to reflect this new direction. Your deep interest in Mexican modernism might not align with where they’re heading, especially since their modernist scholar just retired. Or the department may be heavily SLA (Second Language Acquisition) when that’s not you. You may have simply mismatched yourself to the department because you really wanted to see “Georgetown” on your diploma. If you don’t get in, it might be a favor. Keep applying to other places and find your fit.</p>

<p>In terms of trends in employment, you may want to keep an eye on the increasing demand for Spanish linguists specializing in Second Language Acquisition (SLA), sociolinguistics, bilingualism/heritage speaker linguistics, translation, and in AI. These trends are related to population projections that suggest that Hispanics will outnumber all other minorities in the United States by 2050. Hispanics are gaining or regaining a sense of pride in their language and cultures that may very well lead to more and more U.S. citizens will be speaking Spanish in professional environments and in schools, even in parts of the country that are not usually known for diversity.</p>

<div class="gb-container gb-container-8bde0327">

<p>Finding a job as a Spanish professor in the United States can be easy, or horribly difficult and full of disappointments before you find the place that best suits you. While Spanish is far and away the best foreign language to pursue among the languages in terms of total jobs available, landing a job can be a slog. Hiring decisions are made within the private realms of oft highly-politicized departments, and how departments arrive at their hiring decision can be a complete mystery. The best way to jump-start your careers is by following the points above during your initial program selection process, and start reading the <a href="https://academicjobs.fandom.com/wiki/Spanish_and_Portuguese_2024-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Academic Jobs Wiki for Spanish and Portuguese</a> 2024-2025 to discover the most recent job activity, job seeking problems, and to find out which Spanish departments treat their applicants fairly and which don’t. For example, some universities will post a job and interview applicants because they must follow university and department policies and procedures, but really, they had someone in mind from the beginning. This is a particularly unseemly process that leads to wasting the time of applicants who, in the last round, might fly in and spend days socializing, meeting with graduate students, doing meet-and-greets, and getting drilled during the research presentation they are often asked to do. As you might expect, under these conditions the Academic Job Wiki can seem like chaos because contributors engage in a lot of speculation around what’s “really” going on, and they sometimes argue and deride each other, delete postings made by others, among other things. Still, it’s a useful resource, but don’t let collective anxiety deter you. Pay closer attention to larger trends like declines in tenure-track positions.</p>

<div class="gb-container gb-container-69b33985">

<p>You may be wondering why more people don’t discuss translation/interpretation postgraduate options. In the past, Spanish university departments were run by Spanish literature intellectuals, with maybe a single linguist in the department. Spanish literature has long been an intellectually rigorous and enlightening pursuit; think Spanish Golden Age literature. Typically, anything that could have been construed as commodification of a highly intellectual activity was viewed as less appealing. Thus, no tracks were opened for translation studies or even linguistics. At the time of this writing universities like UC Santa Barbara and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst nest translation studies under Comparative Literature, which seems to make sense given the history. Of course, translation studies can be as rigorously intellectual and enlightening as any other area of study in language. Where translation and AI intersect you’ll have a range of opportunities, as discussed above and below.</p>

<div class="gb-container gb-container-586ec976">

<p>Pursuing a graduate degree in interpretation is an excellent option if you enjoy direct human interaction and thinking on your feet. Unlike translators who often use machine translation and AI to varying degrees, interpretation requires real-time verbal communication and a deep, contextually dependent cultural understanding that machines cannot replicate. The role involves nuanced human relationships, having a human sense for the room and the moods of participants present. For example, you might facilitate communication between a doctor and patient where the doctor is giving the patient chemotherapy options to save her life. In situations like these, understanding cultural context, emotion, and non-verbal cues is crucial. You also get to be fully present and involved in something important. </p>



<p>If you’re curious about the field, organizations like the <a href="https://www.ncihc.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.ncihc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NCIHC (National Council on Interpreting in Health Care)</a> and <a href="https://aiic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AIIC (International Association of Conference Interpreters)</a> showcase professional opportunities. While AI can transcribe speech in 2025, it cannot replace the human interpreter who builds trust, manages cultural dynamics, and ensures accurate communication in high-stakes situations like medical consultations, legal proceedings, or international conferences. The industry will continue to need skilled human interpreters as these personal interactions remain fundamental to effective communication.</p>

<div class="gb-container gb-container-f793e109">

<p>Great relationships can emerge from diverse programs, but so can subtle tensions. If you’re a native English speaker, for example, a fellow grad student who is a native speaker of Spanish may help you advance your communication skills, but they may also seem intimidating because they speak three times as fast as you, have better auditory skills, and they come with a unique range of cultural experiences that are relevant to the Spanish language. But you might find that you have your own unique and strong set of skills, especially when it comes to teaching English-speaking undergraduates (highly prized among future employers). In fact, when you graduate and look for a job, some departments might consider you to be a multifaceted candidate who deserves merit for making your way to an advanced degree in your second language (your L2), Spanish – although that consideration might remain <em>sub rosa</em>. In terms of overall department diversity, you may find that certain departments lean heavily towards Mexican heritage speakers or Peninsular Spanish speakers, or heavily something else. In any case, embrace the diversity you find in Spanish departments.</p>
